## usage

```shell
# create a couchdb service named lolipop
dokku couchdb:create lolipop

# you can also specify the image and image
# version to use for the service
# it *must* be compatible with the
# couchdb image
export COUCHDB_IMAGE="couchdb"
export COUCHDB_IMAGE_VERSION="1.7"
dokku couchdb:create lolipop

# you can also specify custom environment
# variables to start the couchdb service
# in semi-colon separated form
export COUCHDB_CUSTOM_ENV="USER=alpha;HOST=beta"
dokku couchdb:create lolipop

# get connection information as follows
dokku couchdb:info lolipop

# you can also retrieve a specific piece of service info via flags
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --config-dir
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --data-dir
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --dsn
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --exposed-ports
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --id
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --internal-ip
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --links
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --service-root
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --status
dokku couchdb:info lolipop --version

# a bash prompt can be opened against a running service
# filesystem changes will not be saved to disk
dokku couchdb:enter lolipop

# you may also run a command directly against the service
# filesystem changes will not be saved to disk
dokku couchdb:enter lolipop ls -lah /

# a couchdb service can be linked to a
# container this will use native docker
# links via the docker-options plugin
# here we link it to our 'playground' app
# NOTE: this will restart your app
dokku couchdb:link lolipop playground

# the following environment variables will be set automatically by docker (not
# on the app itself, so they wonâ€™t be listed when calling dokku config)
#
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_LOLIPOP_NAME=/lolipop/DATABASE
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_LOLIPOP_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.1:5984
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_LOLIPOP_PORT_5984_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.1:5984
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_LOLIPOP_PORT_5984_TCP_PROTO=tcp
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_LOLIPOP_PORT_5984_TCP_PORT=5984
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_LOLIPOP_PORT_5984_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.1
#
# and the following will be set on the linked application by default
#
#   COUCHDB_URL=couchdb://lolipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-couchdb-lolipop:5984/lolipop
#
# NOTE: the host exposed here only works internally in docker containers. If
# you want your container to be reachable from outside, you should use `expose`.

# another service can be linked to your app
dokku couchdb:link other_service playground

# since COUCHDB_URL is already in use, another environment variable will be
# generated automatically
#
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_BLUE_URL=couchdb://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-couchdb-other-service:5984/other_service

# you can then promote the new service to be the primary one
# NOTE: this will restart your app
dokku couchdb:promote other_service playground

# this will replace COUCHDB_URL with the url from other_service and generate
# another environment variable to hold the previous value if necessary.
# you could end up with the following for example:
#
#   COUCHDB_URL=couchdb://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-couchdb-other-service:5984/other_service
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_BLUE_URL=couchdb://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-couchdb-other-service:5984/other_service
#   DOKKU_COUCHDB_SILVER_URL=couchdb://lolipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-couchdb-lolipop:5984/lolipop

# you can also unlink a couchdb service
# NOTE: this will restart your app and unset related environment variables
dokku couchdb:unlink lolipop playground

# you can tail logs for a particular service
dokku couchdb:logs lolipop
dokku couchdb:logs lolipop -t # to tail

# you can dump the database
dokku couchdb:export lolipop > lolipop.dump

# you can import a dump
dokku couchdb:import lolipop < database.dump

# you can clone an existing database to a new one
dokku couchdb:clone lolipop new_database

# finally, you can destroy the container
dokku couchdb:destroy lolipop
```

## Changing database adapter

It's possible to change the protocol for DATABASE_URL by setting
the environment variable COUCHDB_DATABASE_SCHEME on the app:

```
dokku config:set playground COUCHDB_DATABASE_SCHEME=couchdb2
dokku couchdb:link lolipop playground
```

Will cause COUCHDB_URL to be set as
couchdb2://lolipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-couchdb-lolipop:5984/lolipop

CAUTION: Changing COUCHDB_DATABASE_SCHEME after linking will cause dokku to
believe the service is not linked when attempting to use `dokku couchdb:unlink`
or `dokku couchdb:promote`.
You should be able to fix this by

- Changing COUCHDB_URL manually to the new value.

OR

- Set COUCHDB_DATABASE_SCHEME back to its original setting
- Unlink the service
- Change COUCHDB_DATABASE_SCHEME to the desired setting
- Relink the service

## Backups

Datastore backups are supported via AWS S3 and S3 compatible services like [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio).

You may skip the `backup-auth` step if your dokku install is running within EC2
and has access to the bucket via an IAM profile. In that case, use the `--use-iam`
option with the `backup` command.

Backups can be performed using the backup commands:

```
# setup s3 backup authentication
dokku couchdb:backup-auth lolipop AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# remove s3 authentication
dokku couchdb:backup-deauth lolipop

# backup the `lolipop` service to the `BUCKET_NAME` bucket on AWS
dokku couchdb:backup lolipop BUCKET_NAME

# schedule a backup
# CRON_SCHEDULE is a crontab expression, eg. "0 3 * * *" for each day at 3am
dokku couchdb:backup-schedule lolipop CRON_SCHEDULE BUCKET_NAME

# cat the contents of the configured backup cronfile for the service
dokku couchdb:backup-schedule-cat lolipop

# remove the scheduled backup from cron
dokku couchdb:backup-unschedule lolipop
```

Backup auth can also be set up for different regions, signature versions and endpoints (e.g. for minio):
 
```
# setup s3 backup authentication with different region
dokku couchdb:backup-auth lolipop AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_REGION
 
# setup s3 backup authentication with different signature version and endpoint
dokku couchdb:backup-auth lolipop AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_REGION AWS_SIGNATURE_VERSION ENDPOINT_URL
 
# more specific example for minio auth
dokku couchdb:backup-auth lolipop MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY us-east-1 s3v4 https://YOURMINIOSERVICE
```

## Disabling `docker pull` calls

If you wish to disable the `docker pull` calls that the plugin triggers, you may set the `COUCHDB_DISABLE_PULL` environment variable to `true`. Once disabled, you will need to pull the service image you wish to deploy as shown in the `stderr` output.

Please ensure the proper images are in place when `docker pull` is disabled.
